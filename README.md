‚è∞ Life Scheduler
========================

## Introduction
Scheduling algorithms is a well studied field. Its application can be found in operating system task scheduling, bussiness processes and operation management. However, the applicability of using scheduling algorithms for daily life tasks is less well-known.

Todo applications such as [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) help the users keep track of their tasks. They allow the user to input the deadline, the priority and other related information for each task. Currently, a user has to manually select the tasks to complete. A system that recommend optimal tasks to work on would really helpful.

This project aims to develop a scheduling application for real life tasks. Having a scheduler for tasks improve productivity in the several aspects. First, the user do not have to choose the next task to work on. Second, tasks can be selected in a way that optimally achieve the user's requirements.

## Important questions
* How do real life tasks map to the attributes used in scheduling algorithms (e.g., deadline, processing time, priority, ..).
* What scheduling criteria should be chosen. Commonly used criteria are *flow time*, *lateness*, *throughput* .
* The system should be flexible

## Plan
* [ ] Develop a generic task scheduling backend in python
* [ ] Have a prototype front end
* [ ] Adapt the task scheduler to real tasks
* [ ] Extend to a real application
